Citardauq Formula:

When |4ac| is small in comparison with |b|, one of the
roots may suffer a loss of precision. This root can be found with the
Citardauq Formula which is similar to the Quadratic Formula. By
calculating one of the roots to high precision we can find the other
root with equal precision with R1R2 = c/a.
