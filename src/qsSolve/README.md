The qsSolve function solves the quadratic formula of format ax^2 + bx + c = 0 where a, b, and c are all user input values. The function returns the number of real roots (0, 1, or 2) or an error number if input there was invalid parameters passed to the function or if any calculations exceeded the maximim value of a double.

Automated tests can be run using the make test command. These unit tests check the return values of the qsSolve function against known precision answers.
