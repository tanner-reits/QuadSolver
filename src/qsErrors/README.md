This directory contains the qsErrors function which formats an error message if the quad solver is given invalid input or there was an issue calculating the real roots of the given input.

Error constants are defined in the "qsErrors.h" file and error messages are formatted for each error.

TESTING:
tests for each error message can be displayed by running the 'make run-test' command
